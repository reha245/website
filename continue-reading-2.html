        <p>High above the clouds, in the <strong>Kingdom of the Sky</strong>, lived tiny twinkling stars. Every night, they sparkled brightly, lighting up the world. But one little star, named <strong>Lina</strong>, had a problem—she wasn’t as bright as the others.</p>
        <p>“I wish I could shine like you all,” Lina sighed.</p>
        <p>The other stars tried to cheer her up. “You are special in your own way, Lina,” said the biggest star. But Lina still felt small and dim.</p>
        <p>One night, while playing with a comet, Lina spun too fast—whoosh! She slipped and fell from the sky!</p>
        <p>Down, down, down she went until—plop!—she landed softly in a <strong>little garden</strong>. She blinked her tiny light and looked around. The sky seemed so far away.</p>
        <p>A little boy named <strong>Kian</strong> was playing outside when he saw something glowing in the grass.</p>
        <p>“Wow! A real star!” Kian gasped. He carefully picked her up. “Are you okay?”</p>
        <p>Lina nodded sadly. “But I lost my way home.”</p>
        <p>Kian wanted to help. “Don’t worry, we’ll get you back to the sky!”</p>
        <p>They tried many ways—jumping high, climbing a tree, and even tying balloons to Lina! But nothing worked.</p>
        <p>Then Kian had an idea. “Maybe you just need to shine brighter!”</p>
        <p>He took Lina to the highest <strong>hilltop</strong>, where the sky was the clearest. “Close your eyes and believe in yourself,” he whispered.</p>
        <p>Lina thought about all the happy moments—the warmth of the sky, the laughter of her star friends, and now, Kian’s kindness.</p>
        <p>And then… she began to glow! Brighter and brighter until—whoosh!—she shot back up into the sky!</p>
        <p>That night, Kian looked up and saw a new, extra-bright star twinkling down at him.</p>
        <p>Lina had found her way home. But she never forgot her friend on Earth, shining her brightest just for him.</p>
