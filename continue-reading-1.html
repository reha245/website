        <p><b> A college student, got on her regular bus. The bus was very crowded, and she had to stand, holding onto a pole as the bus moved forward. She looked around and saw many people standing like her, swaying with the movement of the bus. It made her think—standing was like life’s struggles. Sometimes, people had to struggle and stand, while others had a seat. But in the end, whether standing or sitting, everyone would reach their destination. <br>

            After a while, the bus stopped, and a passenger got up to leave. Aanya moved toward the empty seat, but she noticed an elderly woman nearby who could have taken it. Instead, the woman gave her a kind smile and said, "You remind me of my daughter. Take the seat, dear." Aanya felt warm inside and smiled back as she sat down. <BR>
            
            Now that she was sitting, she started noticing the people around her. An old man sat near the window, holding a small photograph. He looked at it with a soft smile, as if remembering a happy moment from long ago.<BR>
            
            A mother sat with her little boy, pointing at things outside the window. The boy’s eyes were big with excitement. Aanya thought about how children see everything as new and amazing.<BR>
            
            Across from her, a lady in a neat business suit was typing on her phone, looking very serious. Maybe she was thinking about an important meeting. Or maybe, she was just tired and wanted a break.
            <br>
            At the back of the bus, a group of students were laughing and talking. Their voices were full of energy and dreams, like the bright sun shining through the window.
            <br>
            With every stop, new people got on, and others got off. Each person had their own story, their own journey. Aanya realized that everyone—whether standing or sitting—was moving forward, just like in life.
<br>
            When the bus reached her stop, Aanya stepped off feeling different. She had not just traveled through the city but had seen a little piece of many lives around her. She walked away with a happy heart, knowing that every journey was special, not just because of where it led, but because of the people along the way.</p>
