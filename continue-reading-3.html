        <p>Meera and Siya had always been curious explorers. Every summer, they visited their grandparents' old cottage, nestled at the edge of a vast, untouched forest. Their grandmother often told them stories about a hidden valley, a place so beautiful that it felt like a dream. But she always warned them—"Never stay after sunset."</p>
        
        <p>One afternoon, their adventurous spirits got the best of them. Ignoring their grandmother's warning, they ventured deep into the woods, following a barely visible trail winding through the trees.

            After what felt like hours, they stepped into a breathtaking valley. The air was filled with the scent of wildflowers, the lake sparkled like a mirror, and a wooden bridge arched gracefully over a tiny stream.</p>
        
        <p>It's like something out of a fairy tale," Siya whispered, running her fingers through the cool water.</p>
    
        <p>Meera smiled. "Maybe we should bring Grandma here tomorrow. She'd love it."</p>


        <p>But as the sun dipped lower, the air grew cold. The sky darkened unnaturally fast. A hush fell over the valley, and then—a whisper.

            Their names.
            
            Siya grabbed Meera’s hand. "Did you hear that?"
            
            Before Meera could answer, mist rolled in from the trees, and a shadowy figure emerged. It had no clear shape, only a long, twisting form that stretched unnaturally as it glided toward them.
            
            "You should not be here," it whispered.
            
            A deep chill ran down their spines. The shadow reached out a wispy, clawed hand.
            
            "RUN!" Meera screamed. </p>
            
            <p>They bolted, crashing through the undergrowth, barely able to see the path in the thickening fog. The valley seemed endless—were they going in circles?
            
            Siya tripped over a root, and Meera yanked her up just as a cold breeze brushed against their backs. The whispering grew louder, turning into a ghostly wail.
            
            Then—darkness.
            
            Meera gasped, sitting upright in bed. Her heart pounded like a drum. Sunlight streamed through the window. She was in her grandparents' cottage.
            
            A dream?
            
            She turned to see Siya already awake, her face pale.
            
            "Was that… a dream?" Meera whispered.
            
            Siya swallowed hard. "Then why are our shoes covered in mud?"
            
            Their eyes widened as they stared at their dirty shoes, bits of crushed wildflowers clinging to them.
            
            The valley. The whispers. The shadow.
            
           </p>



        <p>Maybe it hadn’t been a dream after all</p>
